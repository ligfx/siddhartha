  PRAY is the file format used for installing new agents,
  breeds, and rooms in the Creatures Evolution Engine[0].
  It also forms the basis of NetBabel[1].

  Erkleroo expected.

  ~ how does it work? ~

  A PRAY source file might look like this:

    "en-GB"

    group AGNT "Agent name"
    "Agent Type" 0
    "Agent Description" "Something cool"
    "Dependency Count" 1
    "Dependency 1" "agent.c16"
    "Dependency Category 1" 2

    inline FILE "agent.c16" "agent.c16"

  A compiled PRAY file consists of various 'blocks'. Each
  block starts with a common header, then has type-specific
  data. A parser should read blocks in order, skipping
  blocks it doesn't understand.

    struct block_header {
      char[4] block_type;
      char[128] block_name; // null-terminated
      long block_data_length;
      long block_data_length_uncompressed;
      long block_compressed;
    } __attribute__ ((little-endian));
